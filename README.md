# Introduction

This repository is intended to be used for documenting internals about miscellaneous
classic video games, with a strong focus on cheating (e.g. for creating Game Genie
codes or the like).  The information here can be used for general-purpose romhacking
as well.

Most of the documents in this repository were achieved through manual reverse
engineering efforts on my part.  Some of the tools used were as followed, paired
with many years of experience:

* Genesis / MegaDrive
